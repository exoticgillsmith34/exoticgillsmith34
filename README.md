# MARVEL Level 1 Report
This is a complete report on the MARVEL tasks of Level 1 performed by Amith

# 1)3D printing 
This was an interesting task. I got to know how the 3D printer works. As being a newbie to this subject it was exciting.
I learnt about the prerequisites of a 3D printer, the nozzele temperature, the filament used in the printing process, the importance of the bed temperature and slicing the product
on the software. It was fun.

# 2) Marvel Git-Task
The main repositoruy had the wrong code of adding two numbers. The procedure followed to fix it was to create an **issue**, make a separate brach on that issue, clone the repository,
fix the issue and open a pull request. Working with **GitHub** was my first work on an open sorce project and learned how to contribute to it.

# 3) UBUNTU Task
It was my first experience using Linux IOS. The task involved the usage of the Linux terminal, **mkdir* function to create a file directory in Linux and **cat* function to concatenate 
the contents of two files and present the output.

# 4) Using TINKERCAD
The **TINKERTCAD** software allows us to analyse the electrical circuits and figure the design before building the circuit in real life. The task was to use an ultrasonic sensor and 
estimate the distance between obstacle and the sensor. The results were to be displayed on the serial monitor. The code used to run the simulation was taken by the **ARDIUNO IDE**
website. The circuit was complete and faced no issues. In the circuit i performed on two cases :-
## 1)Obstacle within the range of 40 cm
## 2)Obstacle otside the range of 40 cm.
This is indicated by a LED lamp.
Learning how to use **TINKERCAD** was useful. The interface was user-friendly and got used to it in an instance

# 5) SPEED CONTROL DC MOTOR.
The speed of the motor is controlled through the potentiometer. The code which was uploaded in the ardino was taken from a YOUTUBE source. The circuit was difficult to build,
but it did the job. As the speed of the motor was varying the current reading kept on varying too.

# 6) CONTROL LED TOGGLE USING ESP32
This task allowed us to switch on the LED lamps remotely using our smartphone. The main component used here is the **ESP32**. It works similar to an ardino. The code uploaded
to the ESP32 uses our Tethering Hotspot connection and when the bandwidth is run on the browser we can switch off/on the LED lamps remotely.

## 7) SOLDERING 
Soldering is one of the basic methods of joing to metals. Soldering is a process that joins metal pieces together using a fusible metal alloy called solder. The Solder is made
up of 60% TIN and 40% Lead. This is heated upto a temperature of 650* F. The weld hardens imediately giving a perfect joint. This was the most easiest task.

## 8) ACTIVE PARTICIPATION
On the 6th of July I visited an **INSIDE TALK** conducted by **SAP LABS**. The Technical event fostered the ideas of AI in Business Management. Various speakers of SAP LABS 
disscussed topics of GenAI, Open Source AI, and AI Robotic. The sessions involved using the current market trends and developing a AI model suited for the business. The 
interactive sessions were wholesome!


## 9) REPORT WRITING ON DATA SHEETS
### MQ135 REPORT
We were given the task to write a report on the **MQ135** sensor which is used in smoke detection. Here is the complete report.

## 10) RESOURCE ARTICLE USING MARKDOWN.
I had presented a poster on the occassion of **KAGADA 2023**. The following shows the report we presented during that event
